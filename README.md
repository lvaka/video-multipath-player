# Multipath Video Player

This was my first demo I made for an interview that landed my first web developer job.  Over the phone they mentioned that they were working on a project that needed a video player that acted almost as a choose your own adventure story that would jump to different points in the video.  They didn't want any page reloads.  I spent the weekend before my in person interview coding this small project.

Looking back at this code, I know I'd probably take a much different approach.  I showed this during the interview and got hired on the spot.  The final code evolved into something much different, but this simple demo shows that it does not take much to prove your worth as a developer to a company.
